This is a NOMAD parser for [OpenMX](http://www.openmx-square.org/). It will read OpenMX input and
output files and provide all information in NOMAD's unified Metainfo based Archive format.

For OpenMX please provide at least the files from this table, if applicable
(remember that you always can provide additional files if you want):

|Input Filename| Description|
|--- | --- |
|`<systemname>.out` | **Mainfile** in OpenMX specific plain-text |
