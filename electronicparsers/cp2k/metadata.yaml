  ## Usage notes
  The parser is based on CP2K 2.6.2.

  The CP2K input setting
  [PRINT_LEVEL](https://manual.cp2k.org/trunk/CP2K_INPUT/GLOBAL.html#PRINT_LEVEL)
  controls the amount of details that are outputted during the calculation. The
  higher this setting is, the more can be parsed from the upload.

  The parser will try to find the paths to all the input and output files, but if
  they are located very deep inside some folder structure or outside the folder
  where the output file is, the parser will not be able to locate them. For this
  reason it is recommended to keep the upload structure as flat as possible.

  Here is a list of features/fixes that would make the parsing of CP2K results
  easier:
  - The pdb trajectory output doesn't seem to conform to the actual standard as
    the different configurations are separated by the END keyword which is
    supposed to be written only once in the file. The [format
    specification](http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format) states that
    different configurations should start with MODEL and end with ENDMDL tags.
  - The output file should contain the paths/filenames of different input and
    output files that are accessed during the program run. This data is already
    available for some files (input file, most files produced by MD), but many
    are not mentioned.
