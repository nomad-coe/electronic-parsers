  parserSpecific: "## Usage notes\nThe parser is based on CP2K 2.6.2.\n\nThe CP2K\
    \ input setting\n[PRINT_LEVEL](https://manual.cp2k.org/trunk/CP2K_INPUT/GLOBAL.html#PRINT_LEVEL)\n\
    controls the amount of details that are outputted during the calculation. The\n\
    higher this setting is, the more can be parsed from the upload.\n\nThe parser\
    \ will try to find the paths to all the input and output files, but if\nthey are\
    \ located very deep inside some folder structure or outside the folder\nwhere\
    \ the output file is, the parser will not be able to locate them. For this\nreason\
    \ it is recommended to keep the upload structure as flat as possible.\n\nHere\
    \ is a list of features/fixes that would make the parsing of CP2K results\neasier:\n\
    - The pdb trajectory output doesn't seem to conform to the actual standard as\n\
    \  the different configurations are separated by the END keyword which is\n  supposed\
    \ to be written only once in the file. The [format\n  specification](http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format)\
    \ states that\n  different configurations should start with MODEL and end with\
    \ ENDMDL tags.\n- The output file should contain the paths/filenames of different\
    \ input and\n  output files that are accessed during the program run. This data\
    \ is already\n  available for some files (input file, most files produced by MD),\
    \ but many\n  are not mentioned.\n"
