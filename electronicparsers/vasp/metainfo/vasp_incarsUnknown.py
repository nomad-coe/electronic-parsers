        In vasp.4.2 the augmentation charges are forced to be zero at the boundary of the
        augmentation sphere, therefore results are slightly different from vasp.3.2
        (usually differences are smaller than 0.01 meV). The old behavior can be restored
        by setting LCOMPAT = .TRUE. in the INCAR file.
